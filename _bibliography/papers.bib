   abstract = {Timely and accurate information on crop productivity is essential for characterizing crop growing status and guiding adaptive management practices to ensure food security. Terrestrial biosphere models forced by satellite observations (satellite-TBMs) are viewed as robust tools for understanding large-scale agricultural productivity, with distinct advantages of generalized input data requirement and comprehensive representation of carbon–water-energy exchange mechanisms. However, it remains unclear whether these models can maintain consistent accuracy at field scale and provide useful information for farmers to make site-specific management decisions. This study aims to investigate the capability of a satellite-TBM to estimate crop productivity at the granularity of individual fields using harmonized Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 time series. Emphasis was placed on evaluating the model performance in: (i) representing crop response to the spatially and temporally varying field management practices, and (ii) capturing the variation in crop growth, biomass and yield under complex interactions among crop genotypes, environment, and management conditions. To achieve the first objective, we conducted on-farm experiments with controlled nitrogen (N) fertilization and irrigation treatments to assess the efficacy of using satellite-retrieved leaf area index (LAI) to reflect the effect of management practices in the TBM. For the second objective, we integrated a yield formation module into the satellite-TBM and compared it with the semi-empirical harvest index (HI) method. The model performance was then evaluated under varying conditions using an extensive dataset consisting of observations from four crop species (i.e., soybean, wheat, rice and maize), 42 cultivars and 58 field-years. Results demonstrated that satellite-retrieved LAI effectively captured the effects of N and water supply on crop growth, showing high sensitivity to both the timing and quantity of these inputs. This allowed for a spatiotemporal representation of management impacts, even without prior knowledge of the specific management schedules. The TBM forced by satellite LAI produced consistent biomass dynamics with ground measurements, showing an overall correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93 and a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 31.4 %. However, model performance declined from biomass to yield estimation, with the HI-based method (R = 0.80, RRMSE = 23.7 %) outperforming mechanistic modeling of grain filling (R = 0.43, RRMSE = 43.4 %). Model accuracy for winter wheat was lower than that for summer crops such as rice, maize and soybean, suggesting potential underrepresentation of the overwintering processes. This study illustrates the utility of satellite-TBMs in crop productivity estimation at the field level, and identifies existing uncertainties and limitations for future model developments.},

   abstract = {Featured Application: Change detection for remote sensing images. Aiming at the problem of misdetection caused by the traditional texture characteristic extraction model, which does not describe the correlation among multiple bands, an object-oriented remote sensing image change detection method based on a color co-occurrence matrix is proposed. First, the image is divided into multi-scale objects by graph-based superpixel segmentation, and the optimal scale is determined by the overall goodness F-measure (OGF). Then, except for the extraction of the spectral features, the multi-channel texture features based on the color co-occurrence matrix (CCM) are extracted to consider the correlation among multiple bands. To accurately find the representative features to overcome the impact of feature redundancy, a cumulative backward search strategy (CBSS) is further designed. Finally, the change detection is completed by inputting the difference image of dual time points to the trained random forest model. Taking Shenzhen and Dapeng as the study areas, with Sentinel-2 and Skysat images under different spatial resolutions, and the forest–bareland change type as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by qualitative and quantitative analyses. They show that the proposed algorithm can obtain higher detection accuracy than the texture features without band correlation.},

   abstract = {Superpixel segmentation is an essential step of object-oriented remote sensing image classification, the accuracy of the superpixel segmentation boundary will directly affect the classification result. Most of the traditional superpixel segmentation algorithms rely on spectral similarity and spatial connectivity to construct superpixels. They can not find the accurate boundary in the complex scenes, such as the spatial distribution of ground features being relatively broken, and large differences in the size and shape, especially long-thin shape and circular shape. Aiming at this problem, a superpixel segmentation algorithm based on anisotropic diffusion model named ADS is proposed and applied to image classification. The anisotropic diffusion model originated in thermodynamics has excellent properties in that the diffusion is continuous and smooth and its diffusion speed depends on the medium, which provides convenience for smoothing homogeneous regions and establishing boundary constraints for different ground objects. With this advantage, the diffusion flux model is established to consider the influence of boundary factors and used to simulate the dissimilarity measure with boundary constraints between pixels and seed points by combining the traditional spectral and spatial distance. Then, the seed points of superpixel are optimized under the K-means framework. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested and verified with different spatial resolutions, such as Landsat8 with 30m, Sentinel-2 with 10m, and Skysat with 0.5m. A large number of experiments show that the proposed algorithm can better correct the superpixel boundary fitting deviation problem in complex scenes and effectively promote the improvement of image classification accuracy.},

   abstract = {Airborne hyperspectral images are used for crop identification with a high classification accuracy because of their high spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the tradeoffs between the three core parameters of a hyperspectral imager (SNR, spatial resolution, and spectral resolution) should be considered for designing an efficient imaging system. Only a few reported studies on the analysis of the impact of SNR on identification accuracy are available. Further, the tradeoffs and mutual interactions among these parameters are rarely considered. In this empirical study, our aim was to understand the relationship among the core parameters and their effects on crop identification accuracy by analyzing the tradeoffs and mutual interactions among these parameters. We analyzed the hyperspectral images of a typical plain agricultural area in Xiongan, China, acquired by the newly developed sensor airborne multimodular imaging spectrometer (AMMIS). The fundamental images were transformed to form datasets with different ranges of spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and SNR using data reconstruction methods. We adopted the classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers, and observed the overall accuracy (OA) across the degraded hyperspectral datasets. The experimental results indicated that the OA decreased with a decreasing SNR. As the spectral resolution became coarser, the OA first increased, plateaued, and then decreased. However, the OA increased with decreasing spatial resolution. This study was performed with the goal of bridging the knowledge gap between the back-end hyperspectral sensor designing and its front-end applications.},

   abstract = {In emergency responses to natural disasters, actionable information provided by remote sensing images is crucial to help emergency managers become aware of the situation and assess the magnitude of the damage. Without the accurate prediction of time consumption, choosing an algorithm for land use/land cover (LULC) classification under these emergency circumstances could be blind and subjective. Here, we proposed a full parameter time complexity (FPTC) analysis and the corresponding coefficient \omega to estimate the actual running time of the LULC classification without actually running the code. The FPTC of five general algorithms is derived in this article. After derivation, the FPTC of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) is F(nv+n\{\text\{log\}\}_2\,u), the FPTC of logistic regression (LR) is F(Qm2vn), the FPTC of classification and regression tree (CART) is F((m+1)nv\{\text\{log\}\}_2n), the FPTC of random forest (RF) is F(s(m+1)nv\{\text\{log\}\}_2n), and the FPTC of support vector machine (SVM) is F(m2Qv\ (n+k)). The results show a strong linear relationship between the actual running time and FPTC [R-squared: kNN (0.991), LR (0.997), CART (0.999), RF (1.000), and SVM (0.999)], with different data size. The average root-mean-squared error between the real running time and the estimated running time is 3.34 s, which demonstrates the effectiveness of FPTC. Combining FPTC with the corresponding coefficient \omega, the running time of the classification can be precisely predicted, which will help emergency managers quickly choose algorithms in response to natural disasters with available remote sensing data and limited time.},
